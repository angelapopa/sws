### immediate todos
  
  * find test data
  * install needed tools
  
    ** browser plugins or SOAP UI or Postman in order to test the REST API
    
    ** set up a database and import the test data
    
    ** set up a local http server
    
  * implement a minimal prototype to check if all systems work properly together
  * document the steps from the above steps

### design the REST API
  * identify 10 resources
  * identify at least one action per resource
  * define fields of the resources that can be queried and fields that will be exposed
  * define the api syntax for each action on resources (including the http actions and the http error codes)
  * decide upon the data format (xml/json/other)
  * decide how the HATEOAS can be implemented in this API
  * define mockup api calls and responses
  * check if design guideliness were met
  
### start implementing :)

### implement, test and improve

Topic: Hotel Booking API

### Project setup:

  * the project folder is `node-hotel-booking`
  * run `npm install` in a terminal window at `/sws/node-hotel-booking/` location every time the package.json changes
  * `npm start` - to start the node server
  * if `nodemon` was configured in the main js file, then no restart of the server is needed after each code change
  * for `POST` requests in Postman, don't forget to select `x-www-form-urlencoded` in the `Body` tab.

## TODOs
### design the REST API
  - [ ] identify 10 resources
  - [x] identify at least one action per resource (`GET`, `POST`)
  - [ ] define fields of the resources that can be queried and fields that will be exposed
  - [ ] define the api syntax for each action on resources (including the http actions and the http error codes)
  - [x] decide upon the data format (xml/json/other): JSON
  - [ ] decide how the HATEOAS can be implemented in this API
  - [ ] define mockup api calls and responses
  - [ ] check if design guideliness were met

### start implementing :)
  - [x] create new model classes to fit the data from the new dataset (maybe not all fields from the db need to used in the model)
  - [x] try out GET, POST requests with the new data models on the new database `swshotels` (don't forget to change the db name in the `sever.js file`)
  - [ ] add paging for the get request (`/hotels`)
  - [ ] add navigation (HATEOS)
  - [x] how to define facilities for hotel/room? There is no data in the dataset regarding facilities, so we create an endpoint and add facilities exclusively through the api
  - [ ] how to define availability for rooms? Currently the db has the schema.org value InStock for all entries. So we ignore this info for now. We should handle availability/booking differently somehow.
  - [ ] how to implement booking of rooms????????? since the assignment is called "Hotel Booking API"!!!
